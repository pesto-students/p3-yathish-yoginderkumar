            <h3>What are we dealing with?</h3>
            <p>
              Right now we are living in a very dangerous time where many
              powerful political leaders don'y understand that climate change is
              a huge problem which exist and we are the reason for it
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the <em>Intergovernmental Panel</em> on climate
              change. The most rise in global temperature since the mid-20th
              century is caused by human-related greenhouse gas concentration
            </p>
            <p>
              Id we keep emitting more of these gases, the effects of global
              warming will continue and may worsen the situation.

            <h3>How can we forget plastic?</h3>
            <p>
              In the digital world it's easy to delete data to save the
              environment of PC but here in real world its difficult to get rid
              of plastic as plastic is very harmful material for the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plastic would take upto 1000 years to break down. It is also has
              the potential to leak harmful pollutants into the soil. The
              chemical components of plastic can be absorbed by humans while
              they're working around it and it may lead to negative health
              effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to a report the millions of tons of plastics in
              landfills was equal to 37 million tons of coal and 139 million
              barrels of oil and the report is about 10 years old.

            <h1>Rise in temperature.</h1>
            <p>
              As we know that each year the global temperature is rising rapidly
              and this is a problem of concern.
              <strong>But how hot it can get?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              According to <b>NASA</b>, the average temperature around the globe
              back in 2013 was 14.6 degrees celsius continuing the trend of
              climate change and increasing temperature since <b>1880</b>. The
              10 warmest years have actually happened in the last 20 years.
              <strong>Things are heating up.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              On June 26th, 2018 the town of Quriyat. Oman saw one of the
              hottest nights ever recorded in history. The day was pretty
              intense, reaching the temperature of nearly 50 degrees celsius,
              the night offered no respite from the heat falling to a low of
              only about 42.5 degrees celsius.
